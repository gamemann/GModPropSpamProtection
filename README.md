# Description
This lua addon basically checks when the server is lagging. If the server is lagging, it will check what props are penetrating, it will then delete these specific props until the server stops lagging.

# FAQ
Q: Is this addon still supported?

A: As of 6-05-15, yes it is supported. I originally made this addon for GFL-only. Therefore, you may notice missing features (e.g. documentation on the ConVars). I plan to eventually fully update this addon to support the public.


Q: Does this addon work well?

A: This addon works well (tested on GFL's Purge server). However, there are often cases of innocent users getting their penetrating props removed. Sadly, there isn't much I can do about this issue but I do plan to develop better methods on handling prop spammers in the future.
