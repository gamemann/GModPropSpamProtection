# Description
This lua addon basically checks when the server is lagging. If the server is ever lagging, it will check what props are penetrating, it will delete these specific props until the server stops lagging.

# FAQ
Q: Is this lua addon still supported?

A: Yes, but I haven't worked on this addon for about a year now.

Q: Does this work 100%?

A: My server (GFL Purge) still suffers from prop spammers from time to time, but overall, this works well. I will edit this addon in the future and hope to improve its abilities as a return.

Q: Is there any negative side effects?

A: Yes sadly, especially on large servers. Many innocent props get detected when the server lags since it checks every penetrating prop. I do plan on improving the addon in the future and want to prevent things like this from happening.
