# Description
This lua addon basically checks when the server is lagging. If the server is ever lagging, it will check what props are penetrating, it will delete these specific props until the server stops lagging.

# FAQ
Q: Is this lua addon still supported?
A: Yes, but I haven't worked on this addon for a very long time.

Q: Does this work 100%?
A: My server (GFL Purge) still suffers from prop spammers from time to time, but overall, this works well. I will edit the addon in the future and improve it's abilities.

Q: Is there any negative side effects?
A: Sadly yes, especially on large servers. Many innocent props get deleted when the server lags since it checks every single prop. I do plan on improving the addon in the future and want to prevent things like this from happening.
